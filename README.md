# Auckland Transport Services App

## What is it?
ATSP is a small app built using React that leverages realitme information from the Auckland Transport Authority [locations API](https://dev-portal.at.govt.nz/products). You can learn more about them [here](https://at.govt.nz/about-us/)

## Ok, how does this work?
Simple open the app from [here](https://jmmarco.github.io/auckland-transport-info/).

## Wait, the app is a single file?
Yes, the app was built using a single `index.html` and using [the official React UMD production builds](https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html) that are served via CDN.

## Is this the best way to create a React App?
Most certainly not. However it's a quick wat to do so. Also, by using simple HTML files embeded with JS you can host them on GitHub pages.
The "appropiate" way to create a react app is done using [`create-react-app`](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-new-app.html#create-react-app)
